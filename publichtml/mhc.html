            Mental health conditions are a broad category of disorders that affect a person's thoughts, emotions, 
            behavior, and overall psychological well-being. These conditions can range from mild to severe and may be 
            temporary or chronic. There are various mental health conditions, each with its own set of symptoms and 
            treatment options.

                        Depression, also known as major depressive disorder (MDD) or clinical depression, is a mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in daily activities. It is more than just experiencing occasional sadness or "the blues."
